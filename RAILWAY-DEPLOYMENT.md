# 🚂 Railway.app Deployment - Updated Configuration

## ✅ Status: COMPATIBLE

Your Railway deployment is **fully compatible** with the new project structure!

---

## 📋 What Railway Uses

Railway.app deploys your application using:

1. **Dockerfile** → `config/Dockerfile` ✅
2. **Source Code** → `src/` (unchanged) ✅
3. **Maven Build** → `pom.xml` (unchanged) ✅

---

## 🔧 Railway Configuration

### Option 1: Railway Detects Dockerfile Automatically

If Railway auto-detected your Dockerfile, you need to update the build settings:

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to **Settings** → **Build**
4. Update **Dockerfile Path** to:
   ```
   config/Dockerfile
   ```

### Option 2: Railway Uses Nixpacks (Default)

If Railway uses Nixpacks (auto-detection), it will:
- ✅ Automatically find `pom.xml`
- ✅ Build your Java application
- ✅ Deploy it

**No changes needed!** Railway will work as before.

### Option 3: Using railway.toml (Recommended)

Create a `railway.toml` in your project root to explicitly configure Railway:

```toml
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "config/Dockerfile"

[deploy]
startCommand = "java -jar app.jar"
healthcheckPath = "/actuator/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline (Already Updated)

Your GitHub Actions workflow now correctly references:
```yaml
file: ./config/Dockerfile  # ✅ Updated!
```

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
GitHub Push (main)
    ↓
GitHub Actions CI/CD
    ├─ Build & Test (Java/Maven)
    ├─ Build Docker Image (config/Dockerfile)
    ├─ Push to DockerHub
    └─ Security Scan
         ↓
Railway.app
    └─ Pulls & Deploys
```

## 📁 File Paths Reference

| Resource | Old Path | New Path | Railway Impact |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Dockerfile** | `./Dockerfile` | `config/Dockerfile` | ⚠️ Update build settings |
| **docker-compose** | `./docker-compose.yml` | `config/docker-compose.yml` | ❌ Not used |
| **Source** | `src/` | `src/` | ✅ No change |
| **pom.xml** | `./pom.xml` | `./pom.xml` | ✅ No change |
| **K8s configs** | N/A | `config/k8s/` | ❌ Not used |

---

## ✅ What's Safe to Push

You can safely push all these new files:

```
✅ config/k8s/           # Railway ignores these
✅ scripts/              # Railway ignores these
✅ docs/                 # Railway ignores these
✅ config/Dockerfile     # Railway will use this
✅ .github/workflows/    # GitHub Actions (updated)
```

**Railway only cares about:**
- `config/Dockerfile` (if using Docker build)
- `pom.xml` (if using Nixpacks)
- `src/` (source code)

Everything else is ignored!

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### When You Push to GitHub:

1. **GitHub Actions runs:**
   - ✅ Builds Java app
   - ✅ Runs tests
   - ✅ Builds Docker image from `config/Dockerfile`
   - ✅ Pushes to DockerHub
   - ✅ Runs security scan

2. **Railway detects push:**
   - ✅ Pulls latest code
   - ✅ Builds using `config/Dockerfile` or Nixpacks
   - ✅ Deploys to production

---

## 🎯 Action Items

### 1. Update Railway Build Settings (If Using Dockerfile)

```
Railway Dashboard
  → Your Service
  → Settings
  → Build
  → Dockerfile Path: config/Dockerfile
```

### 2. Or Create railway.toml (Recommended)

Add this file to your project root:

```toml
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "config/Dockerfile"
```

### 3. Test Deployment

After pushing:
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: organize project structure"
git push origin main
```

Watch Railway redeploy automatically!

---

## 🧪 Verify Deployment

After Railway deploys, test your endpoints:

```powershell
# Health check
curl https://calculator-service-production.up.railway.app/actuator/health

# Test API
curl -X POST https://calculator-service-production.up.railway.app/api/calculator/calculate `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"number1": 10, "number2": 5, "operation": "+"}'
```

---

## 📊 Deployment Comparison

### Before (Working)
```
Railway → Dockerfile (root) → Build → Deploy
```

### After (Also Works!)
```
Railway → config/Dockerfile → Build → Deploy
```

**Same result, just cleaner organization!** ✨

---

## ⚠️ Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Railway Can't Find Dockerfile
**Solution:** Update Dockerfile path in Railway settings to `config/Dockerfile`

### Issue 2: Build Fails
**Solution:** Railway might be looking for old path. Create `railway.toml` (see above)

### Issue 3: Environment Variables Missing
**Solution:** Railway env vars are preserved, no changes needed!

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Your Railway deployment will continue to work perfectly!**

✅ No breaking changes  
✅ Just update Dockerfile path in Railway settings  
✅ All new K8s/docs/scripts files are ignored by Railway  
✅ CI/CD pipeline already updated  

**You're good to push!** 🚀
