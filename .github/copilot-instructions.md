# GitHub Actions Workflow Notes

## Expected VS Code Warnings

The `ci-cd.yml` workflow file may show warnings about "Context access might be invalid" for:
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

**These warnings are false positives** and can be safely ignored. 

### Why?
VS Code's GitHub Actions extension cannot access encrypted repository secrets during local editing. The secrets ARE properly configured in the GitHub repository settings and work correctly during CI/CD pipeline execution.

### Verification
The CI/CD pipeline runs successfully, proving the secrets are configured correctly:

### To Suppress Warnings (Optional)
If you want to hide these warnings in VS Code:
1. Disable the GitHub Actions extension validation
2. Or add this to `.vscode/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "github-actions.workflows.validate": false
   }
   ```

However, this is **not necessary** - the workflow is working perfectly!
